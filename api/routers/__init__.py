"""
This subpackage contains the API routes. Each module contains a router path the same as the module's name, so /people
and /notes. Routers add a prefix to each path operation created by the router, making them convenient for grouping
endpoints with similar functionality and remove the redundancy of adding the same prefix to each endpoint.
